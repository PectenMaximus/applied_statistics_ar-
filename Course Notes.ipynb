    "#### Normal Distribution\n",
    "**Normal distribution**, also known as the Gaussian distribution, is a probability distribution that is symmetric about the mean, showing that data near the mean are more frequent in occurrence than data far from the mean. The normal distribution appears as a \"bell curve\" when graphed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Formula for Normal Distribution:\n",
    "\n",
    "![image-4.png](attachment:image-4.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- x = value of the variable or data being examined and f(x) the probability function\n",
    "- μ = the mean\n",
    "- σ = the standard deviation\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal distribution model is key to the **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)** which states that averages calculated from independent, identically distributed random variables have approximately normal distributions, regardless of the type of distribution from which the variables are sampled.\n",
    "\n",
    "The normal distribution is one type of symmetrical distribution. Symmetrical distributions occur when a dividing line produces two mirror images. Not all symmetrical distributions are normal since some data could appear as two humps or a series of hills in addition to the bell curve that indicates a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "The **empirical rule** - For all normal distributions, 68.2% of the observations will appear within plus or minus one standard deviation of the mean; 95.4% will fall within +/- two standard deviations; and 99.7% within +/- three standard deviations.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](attachment:image.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Skewness** measures the degree of symmetry of a distribution. The normal distribution is symmetric and has a skewness of zero. If the distribution of a data set instead has a skewness less than zero, or negative skewness (left-skewness), then the left tail of the distribution is longer than the right tail; positive skewness (right-skewness) implies that the right tail of the distribution is longer than the left.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image-2.png](attachment:image-2.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Kurtosis** measures the thickness of the tail ends of a distribution to the tails of a distribution. The normal distribution has a kurtosis equal to 3.0. Distributions with larger kurtosis greater than 3.0 exhibit tail data exceeding the tails of the normal distribution (e.g., five or more standard deviations from the mean).\n",
